The makefile present in this folder is for converting a file full of short texts
(tweets) into a 2 files of frequency tables (that can be used by the Metric Spaces
Library). Just use make to create an exe call converter.
After This, you can use ./converter "parameters" in order to use it.
This parameters are:
- ./converter tweetFile nTweets seed trainingFile testingFile
Legend:
*tweetFile: name of the file that has the tweets.
*nTweets: the number of tweets that you want to use for training the index
         (if it's 0, it converts all the tweets to tables in the testingFile).
*seed: the random seed that will be used to generate the samples
       (uniformly disribuited)
*trainingFile: name of the file that will contain the training sample of frequency
               tables
*testingFile: name of the file that will contain the testing sample of frequency
              tables
Example: ./converter finalTweets.txt 10000 30 train.txt test.txt
The example will take 10k tweets for the training sample and leave the rest to
the testing sample.
